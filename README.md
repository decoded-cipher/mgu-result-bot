# MGU Result Scraper
This simple project aims to get the result screenshots of a list of students from [Mahatma Gandhi University](https://www.mgu.ac.in/) result portal. First of all, MGU doen't have a fixed official URL for accessing all results. They keep on changing as the results get published. Two prominant links *(active as of now)* for accessing results are listed down below:
> The accuracy of these links are questionable as time passes. But the element heirarchy within result pages remains the same always.
- [UG Exam Results](https://dsdc.mgu.ac.in/exQpMgmt/index.php/public/ResultView_ctrl/)
- [PG Exam Results](https://pareeksha.mgu.ac.in/Pareeksha/index.php/Public/PareekshaResultView_ctrl/index/3)
